# NLTK ML

## Introduction
This repository contains various machine learning projects and experiments, primarily utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and other machine learning libraries in Python. The projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to follow along and understand the code and results.

## Installation
To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. 

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sa1f27/nltk_ml.git
    cd nltk_ml
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the `nltk_ml` directory and open any of the `.ipynb` files to explore the projects.
